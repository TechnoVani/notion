              description="Health insurance is a contract between the insurer and the policyholder in which the insurance company agrees to reimburse medical expenses incurred by the policyholder during the policy's duration. According to the terms of the policy, the insured may face medical costs due to illness or unfortunate accidents that require hospital treatment. To access the benefits of a health insurance policy, the policyholder must pay a specified amount regularly, known as a premium. This premium, set by the insurance company, must be paid consistently—whether monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually—without exception."
