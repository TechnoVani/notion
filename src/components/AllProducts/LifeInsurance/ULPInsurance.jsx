                  A ULIP (Unit Linked Insurance Plan) is a type of insurance
                  policy that provides both life insurance coverage and
                  investment opportunities. With a ULIP, part of the premium you
                  pay goes towards life insurance, while the other part is
                  invested in various funds, such as bond, debt, or equity
                  funds. It&apos;s important to note that the investment
                  component is subject to market risks, meaning the value of
                  your investment can fluctuate based on market conditions.
