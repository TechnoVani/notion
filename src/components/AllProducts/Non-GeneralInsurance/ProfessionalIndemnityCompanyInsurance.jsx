                  Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) for companies provides
                  critical protection against financial liabilities arising from
                  professional mistakes, negligence, or omissions in the
                  services they offer. This type of insurance safeguards
                  businesses from claims that could result in client financial
                  loss or reputational damage. It covers legal fees,
                  compensation payouts, and defense costs, ensuring that
                  companies remain protected even in the event of professional
                  disputes or errors. Whether itâ€™s an error in advice or a
                  service-related oversight, PII helps maintain business
                  continuity and protect the company&apos;s bottom line.
